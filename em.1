.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B em [options]
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I em
is an emulator for the Prime 50-Series minicomputer family.  Prime's
original systems were compatible with Honeywell x16 systems.  Prime
heavily extended the architecture.  The emulator supports:
.IP \(bu
all Prime CPU modes: 16S, 32S, 32R, 64R, 64V, 32I
.IP \(bu
all Prime models, from the P400 to P6550
.IP \(bu
up to 512MB of memory, depending on the Primos rev and CPU
.IP \(bu
a system console
.IP \(bu
128 incoming telnet terminal connections
.IP \(bu
8 disk controllers, 8 drives each
.IP \(bu
support for all 25 disk drives sold by Prime
.IP \(bu
a tape controller, 4 drives, using the .TAP format
.IP \(bu
a PNC controller emulating RingNet over TCP/IP
.IP \(bu
a bypass for Primos system serial number checks
.IP \(bu
Unix utilities to read/write physical tapes & Magsav tapes

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fB-boot \fIprogram [ss [ds]]\fR
.IP
Instructs
.B em
to boot the .SAVE-format program in host file
.I program
directly.  This is most useful for running standalone utilities such
as diagnostics or MAKE.  The sense and data switch registers may
optionally be set.  The register values are specified in octal.
.PP
\fB-boot \fIprogram ["regs"]\fR
.IP
As above, but set the initial values of the A, B, X and K registers
from the RVEC area of the program file.  The word "regs" is literally
specified on the command line, without the quotes.
.PP
\fB-boot \fIss [ds]\fR
.IP
Boot the machine based on the front panel interpretation of the
specified sense and data switch settings.
.PP
\fB-boot help\fR
.IP
Provide a summary of booting options and exit.
.PP
\fB-cpuid \fIidno|modelname\fR
.IP
Sets the CPU model which will be emulated.  This may be specified
using either the id number as returned by the
.B STPM
processor instruction, or using the name of the model.  A list of
id numbers and model names appears in the CPU MODELS section below.
.PP
\fB-ds \fIdataswitches\fR
.IP
Specify the settings of the emulated front panel data switches.
.PP
\fB-map|-maps \fI[filename]\fR
.IP
Specify the name of a PRIMOS load map to read.  Symbols are extracted
from the map and used to enhance halt and trace output.
.PP
\fB-mem \fImemsizeMB\fR
.IP
Set the size of emulated main RAM.
.PP
\fB-naddr \fIpnclistenaddr\fR
.IP
Set the IP address on which
.IR em 's
Prime Network Controller will listen for connections from other
emulated PNCs.  If no external emulated systems will be included
in the ring network, it may be more secure to use 127.0.0.1 for
this.  The default is 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces on the host).
.PP
\fB-nport \fIpnclistenport\fR
.IP
Set the TCP port on which
.IR em 's
PNC emulation will listen for connections from other emulated PNCs.
If not specified, PNC emulation will be disabled.
.PP
\fB-ss \fIsenseswitches\fR
.IP
Specify the settings of the emulated front panel sense switches.
.PP
\fB-tport \fIamlclistenport\fR
.IP
Sets the TCP port on which
.IR em 's
AMLC emulation will listen for incoming telnet connections.
If not specified, AMLC emulation will be disabled.
.PP
\fB-trace \fItracetype(s)\fR
.IP
Select trace types which will be enabled.  Trace elements
are written to
.I trace.log
on the host.  Multiple trace types may be listed, separated by
spaces.  Tracing may be initially turned off including the
.I off
trace type.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH FILES
.TP
\fR.lock
Prevents multiple instances of the emulator from simultaneously
accessing disk and tape files in this directory.
.TP
ring0.map
PRIMOS kernel load map for ring 0 routines.  Will be automatically
loaded by
.I em
if other names are not specified.  Symbols extracted from this file
are used to enhance halt and trace output.
.TP
ring3.map
PRIMOS kernel load map for ring 3 routines.  Will be automatically
loaded by
.I em
if other names are not specified.  Symbols extracted from this file
are used to enhance halt and trace output.
.TP
ring.cfg
A list of nodes in the ring network.  Fields are node number,
ip address and port, unique id (essentially a password).
.TP
amlc.cfg
Used to associate amlc lines with specific hardware devices, or to
configure outbound socket connections.
.TP
ttymsg
The text in this file is sent on each newly accepted inbound telnet
connection.
.TP
mtN
A tape image in
.IR simh .tap
format, or a symlink to such a file.
.I N
is a digit 0-7 indicating which tape drive unit.
.TP
diskNNuN.TYPE
A disk image file.
.I NN
indicates the octal address of the controller to which this emulated
drive is attached.
.I N
indicates the unit number of the drive on that controller.
.I TYPE
indicates the drive model, and thus its size and geometry.  A list of
supported drive types appears in the DRIVE TYPE section below.
.TP
error.log
Errors are written to this file during operation.  It is overwritten
at each invocation.
.TP
console.log
All console output is also written to this file.  It is overwritten
at each invocation.
.TP
trace.log
Any selected trace output is written to this file.  It is overwritten
at each invocation.
.\" ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH TRACING
.PP
If tracing is compiled into the emulator, it may be enabled from
the command line.  Event types to log are selected via the
.B -trace
option.  Tracing may start enabled or disabled, depending on whether
the
.I off
trace type is supplied.  Tracing may be dynamically turned on and
off by typing the character ctrl-T on the console.  Trace files can
rapidly become very large, and incur a significant performance penalty
on the emulator.  The following trace types are supported:
.TS

tlb|STLB and IOTLB changes
OWNERL of user#|Trace in the context of this user
instruction count|Trace after specified number of instructions
octal segno|Trace execution in the given segment number
process number|Trace execution of his user number
